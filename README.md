# Bug

The issue occurs when using `http-proxy` with Bun. I have created a repo reproducing this (see `http-proxy` branch): https://github.com/joshunrau/bun-vite-bug.

A dummy server listening on port 8000 is configured to send a JSON response with some randomly generated bytes (100KB). A proxy server listening on port 9000 proxies requests to port 8000. 

When run with NodeJS (`node main.js`) everything works as expected. However, when running with Bun (`bun main.js`) the HTTP request occasionally hangs.

## Reproduce

### Step 1: Start Dummy Server in Terminal 1

```shell
bun main.js
```

### Step 2: Attempt to Fetch Data Until It Freezes

```shell
curl localhost:9000
```
